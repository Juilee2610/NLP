Task 1: Topic Modeling

Conducted topic modeling using LDA and BERTopic.

Tested topic numbers (K) from 1 to 10 and evaluated coherence scores.

Compared LDA and BERTopic results to determine the most interpretable model.

Visualized the best topic model results with word clouds.

Tools Used

Topic Modeling: BERTopic, LDA, Gensim

Visualization: Matplotlib, Wordcloud

Results

Identified optimal topic numbers with coherence scores.

Highlighted key topics through word clouds.




Task 2: Named Entity and Affective Analysis

Performed Named Entity Recognition (NER) using spaCy to extract mentions of 'Hamas' and 'Israel'.

Conducted affective analysis with POS tagging and sentiment scoring using the NRC-VAD lexicon.

Analyzed dominance scores through dependency parsing and identified descriptive patterns.

Visualized surrounding words for each entity using word clouds.

Tools Used

NER & Sentiment Analysis: spaCy, NRC-VAD lexicon

Parsing: Dependency parsing

Visualization: Matplotlib, Wordcloud

Results

Extracted and analyzed entity-specific sentiment and dominance patterns.

Compared word clouds to highlight descriptive differences for 'Hamas' and 'Israel'.





Task 3: Predictive Modeling

Built a predictive model using BERT, RoBERTa, or XLNet to predict Reddit post scores.

Fine-tuned the model using Simple Transformers.

Evaluated model performance with 10-fold cross-validation using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Tools Used

Modeling: BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet

Fine-Tuning: Simple Transformers, Hugging Face Transformers

Evaluation: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Cross-validation

Results

Trained and fine-tuned transformer-based models.

Assessed performance using cross-validation and MSE metrics.

Analyzed results to identify the most effective model for predicting post scores.
